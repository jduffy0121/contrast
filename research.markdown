**Current Work:**
  
I am working with the Ultrafast Nonlinear Optics (UNO) Research Group at Auburn University. 
I assisted with the devolpment of a package to fit experimental data and simulate Rotational-Anisotropic Second-Harmonic Generation (RA-SHG).
SHG, sometimes called frequency doubling, is a nonlinear optical process which occurs when photons interact with a nonlinear crystal
(a crystal is nonlinear if the polarization is not directly proportional to the electric field). The package aims to both fit and simulate RA-SHG data for the
different radiation sources (electric dipole, electric quadrpole, magnetic dipole) and allow for any arbitrary lattice plane.  
This package can be found [here](https://github.com/jduffy0121/SHG_dev). 


**Previous Work:**

| Comet Research Group | PI: Dr. Dennis Bodewits | Feb 2022 - May 2024 | Auburn University |

I focused on the simulation of the radiative processes of photodissociation in a cometary atmosphere.

**My Interest Include:** 
  
Condensed matter physics, quantum optics, computational/mathematical modeling, artificial intelligence/learning
algorithms, data science, numerical analysis, optimization.
