I am currently finishing up my undergraduate degree at Auburn University. 
After I finish in the spring, I plan to head to graduate school for physics with a focus in condensed matter and computational physics.
At Auburn, I have taken a wide range of courses in physics, computer science, and applied mathematics.

**Education:**

| **B.S. Physics**  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Minor: Mathematics*| 2020 - Present | Auburn University | 
| **B.S. Computer Science** <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Certificate: Artificial Intelligence Engineering*| 2020 - Present | Auburn University |

**Hobbies:**  
  
Outside of the lab and classroom, I enjoy working out, hiking, and reading. 
Two of my favorite books are "Breakfast of Champions" by Kurt Vonnegut and "The Stranger" by Albert Camus (I'd naturally recommend both highly).  
  
*"My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, 
why it is as it is and why it exists at all."* ~ Stephen Hawking
