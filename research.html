  <b>Current Work:</b><br>
  I am working with the Ultrafast Nonlinear Optics (UNO) Research Group at Auburn University. 
  I assisted with the devolpment of a package to fit experimental data and simulate Rotational-Anisotropic Second-Harmonic Generation (RA-SHG).
  SHG, sometimes called frequency doubling, is a nonlinear optical process which occurs when photons interact with a nonlinear crystal
  (a crystal is nonlinear if the polarization is not directly proportional to the electric field). The package aims to both fit and simulate RA-SHG data for the
  different radiation sources (electric dipole, electric quadrpole, magnetic dipole) and allow for any arbitrary lattice plane.  
  This package can be found <a href="https://github.com/jduffy0121/SHG_dev">here</a>.<br><br>
