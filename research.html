  I am working with the Ultrafast Nonlinear Optics (UNO) Research Group at Auburn University. 
  I assisted with the devolpment of a package to fit experimental data and simulate Rotational-Anisotropic Second-Harmonic Generation (RA-SHG).
  SHG, sometimes called frequency doubling, is a nonlinear optical process which occurs when photons interact with a nonlinear crystal
  (a crystal is nonlinear if the polarization is not directly proportional to the electric field). The package aims to both fit and simulate RA-SHG data for the
  different radiation sources (electric dipole, electric quadrpole, magnetic dipole) and allow for any arbitrary lattice plane.  
  This package can be found <a href="https://github.com/jduffy0121/SHG_dev">here</a>.<br><br>

  <b>Previous Work:</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Comet Research Group (Feb 2022 - May 2024)<br>
    <p>
    I focused on the simulation of the radiative processes of photodissociation in a cometary atmosphere.
    During my work with the group, I created multiple GUIs to model a new vectorial model for comets containing
    mostly H20, CO2, or HCN moleculues in PyQt5 and JupyterLab. Futhermore, I also assisted in the devolpment of a
    package to determine H20 production per second of UVOT comet images collected by the Neil 
    Gehrels Swift Observatory. This package can be found 
    <a href="https://github.com/sjoset/swift_comet_pipeline/tree/main">here</a>.<br> 
    During my time with the group, I recieved an undergraduate research fellowship for the 2023 - 2024 academic year.
